I am a CS Ph.D. student at the University of Rochester advised by [Prof. Anson Kahng](https://ansonkahng.com/). Previously, I was a computer science and economics double-major at Dartmouth College and graduated class of 2024.
My research interests include computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, and decision-making in general.
Outside of research, I am interested in classical music and art history.
I have also spend time in the international affairs space, including working on some socio-political campaigns (if you're interested in specifics, [email me](mailto:alina.chadwick@gmail.com)).
