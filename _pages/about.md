I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Rochester and am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Anson Kahng](https://ansonkahng.com/).
Previously, I was a Computer Science and Economics double major at Dartmouth College ('24).
My research lies at the intersection of Computer Science and Economics and my interests include computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, and decision-making.
Outside of research, I am interested in classical music and art, and have also spent time in the social activism space (if you're interested in specifics, [email me](mailto:alina.chadwick@gmail.com)).
