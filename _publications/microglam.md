In this paper, we present a cosmetic-specific skin image dataset. It consists of skin images from 45 patches (5 skin patches each from 9 participants) of size 8mm*8mm under three cosmetic products (i.e., foundation, blusher, and highlighter). We designed a novel capturing device inspired by LightStage [Debevec et al. 2000]. Using the device, we captured over 600 images of each skin patch under diverse lighting conditions in 30 seconds. We repeated the process for the same skin patch under three cosmetic products. Finally, we demonstrate the viability of the dataset with an image-to-image translation-based pipeline for cosmetic rendering and compared our data-driven approach to an existing cosmetic rendering method [Kim and Ko 2018].
